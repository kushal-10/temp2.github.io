# A Simple Word Game: taboo

In this game one player (the Describer) describes a target word for another player to guess (Guesser).
The Describer must explain the target word concept without using neither the word itself, nor a part of the word.
For example, when the target word is _flashlight_, the Describer cannot use the words _light_ or _flash_.
After each incorrect guess by the Guesser, the Describer can add to his description.
The game ends when the Guesser guesses correctly or a maximum number of turns has been reached.

The game tests a cLLM's ability to describe concepts and give meaning definitions.
It also tests whether it can detect parts of words and its helpfulness in the game context.
For example, if a Describer does not alter or extend its initial description after an incorrect guess, we consider this unhelpful behavior.
On the opposite side, if a Guesser repeats an earlier guess, it has not understood the game goal well enough to make real progress at each turn.
