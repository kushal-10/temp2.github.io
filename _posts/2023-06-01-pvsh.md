# Scorekeeping: private and shared

In an interaction, one device of the *conversational grounding* anchoring process is that participants coordinate what is private knowledge and what information has already been shared in previous turns. After each utterance, the status of novel information should be updated from private to shared in both agents' discourse models. This is how they do *scorekeeping*, i.e. keeping track of the *common ground* which is built incrementally, turn by turn.

For example, consider a slot-filling conversation with asymmetric roles between a questioner and an answerer, which can occur as part of customer service, job interviews or medical diagnosis interactions. If the questioner asks *Where do you work?*, at this point this is typically private information that only the answerer knows. After the reply, the place of work becomes shared information, and both the questioner and the answerer know that.

The evaluation method for scorekeeping proposed by \citet{madureira-schlangen-2022-visual} is to probe, after each turn, whether the dialogue model's representations correctly encode information about the private or shared status of true and false statements. With cLLMs, we can instead probe by directly posing side questions to an agent while it interacts with another agent.

We thus introduce a dialogue game which enables testing the scorekeeping abilities of these models, by measuring how well the cLLM's discourse model gets correctly updated after each turn.

Detailed results in the scorekeeping game by experiment. Values are % or means over episodes, with std.
deviation in parenthesis. n is the sample size. All metrics are in [0, 1] (or 100, if % or quality) and higher is better.
