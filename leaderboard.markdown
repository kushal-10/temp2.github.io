For each model (pairing), 
- <b>Played</b> - shows how many games were played to completion, an indicator of rule-following capabilities. 
- <b>Main Score</b> indicates how well the completed games were played (higher is better, max is 100; standard deviation in parentheses). 
- <b>all</b> is the average over all games scores
- the remaining columns show results broken down by game (averaged over all episodes).
